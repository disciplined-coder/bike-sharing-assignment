## General Information
- The project studies the bike sharing dataset, understands the bike sharing demand in the past based on the independent variables. 
- It models the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- The modeling is done using Linear Regression since the target variable has a linear relation with the independent variable `temperature`.
- The model will be used by the management to manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and the customer's expectations.
